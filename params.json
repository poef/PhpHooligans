{"name":"Phphooligans","tagline":"","body":"### PHP Hooligans\r\n\r\nPHP developers of the world, it is time to rebel. Throw off the yoke of the oppressors. There is no [right way to PHP](http://www.phptherightway.com/), only the hooligan way!\r\n\r\nOk, so maybe that is a bit over the top, but this site is meant to poke, to question general wisdom and make people think about what works, what doesn't work and most importantly what makes things interesting and keeps programming fun. Mostly in PHP.\r\n\r\nThe hooligans have a [manifesto](https://github.com/poef/PhpHooligans/blob/master/Manifesto.md), ofcourse. Where would we be without another programming related manifesto. \r\n\r\nIn addition we have a list of 'fights'. These are topics we hooligans have [strong opinions about, weakly held](http://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/07/strong_opinions.html). Simply put: we don't have the answers, but we want to learn from eachother, we want opinions to clash, we want you to invest in backing up your opinions, question your beliefs and those of others.\r\n\r\nEach fight is on a seperate wiki page. Each wiki page will also have a discussion page and a 'fallacies' page. Fallacies are claims and counterclaims which have been sufficiently proven to be incorrent, unsound or otherwise not a good idea.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
